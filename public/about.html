<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ryl Zenrose Marciano, a 27-year-old student currently 
  in my 4th year of pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
  at Philippine Women's University Calamba. With a passion for technology, I enjoy 
  exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems and continuously developing my
  skills to stay at the forefront of the IT field. My academic journey has been an
  exciting mix of challenges and learning, shaping me into a driven and resilient 
  individual.</p>

<p>
  Outside of my studies, I'm a proud cat lover and an avid fan of anime.
   These interests allow me to unwind and fuel my creativity. 
   Mobile gaming is another passion of mine, offering a perfect mix of entertainment and
  inspiration as I explore the intersection of technology and fun. Music also plays a big part in my life, 
  giving me moments of peace and motivation when I need them most.

<p>When it comes to simple joys,
  I have a sweet tooth that I love indulging. Whether it's exploring new desserts or 
  enjoying my favorite treats, eating sweets always brightens my day. I believe that 
  balance is key, and these personal interests keep me grounded and energized as I work 
  toward my goals in the tech world.</p>
